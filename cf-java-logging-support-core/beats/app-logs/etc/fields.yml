summary: |
  This is a specification of the "app-logs beat" message type that we use to store
  "application logs" written via a proper logging infrastructure implementation.

  NOTE: For Java applications running on CF, this is our logging support library, see
  https://github.com/SAP/cf-java-logging-support

  Field names follow the convention that we're not using camel case names, but
  rather use "_" as a delimiter between parts.

  For any field that actually represents a measure (or metric for that matter)
  the name includes a descriptive suffix mnemonic that helps identifying the unit,
  e.g.:

    * "_ms" -> milliseconds
    * "_b"  -> bytes
    * "_p"  -> percent
    * "_at" -> date with time
    * "_ts" -> timestamp

ctx:
  type: group
  description: |
    This group contains context information for the given application log message
    such that analytics can slice and dice information based on these criteria.

  fields:
    - name: "written_at"
      type: date
      required: true
      description: |
        The human-readable date when the message was written.

    - name: "written_ts"
      type: long
      required: true
      example: 1456820553816849408
      description: |
        The timestamp in nano-second precision when the message was written.

    - name: "correlation_id"
      type: string
      required: true
      example: "db2d002e-2702-41ec-66f5-c002a80a3d3f"
      description: |
        A unique identifier that can be used to correlate multiple messages into a logical unit.
        
        Currently, we use a UUID for that matter, but future versions may use
        a different key for this.

        "-" indicates that no proper value could be provided.

        NOTE: As these type of messages can be written at any time and outside
        a "request context" it may happen that this correlation id does not
        match with any other. Logging implementations may provide a way to
        inherit correlation ids from request processing layers further up in
        the processing stack. If so, that id should be used.

    - name: "request_id"
      string: string
      required: false
      example: "e24a5963-95eb-4568-b1ae-81b67c41e99a"
